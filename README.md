#### This is how it looks like.
#### From this project, I got to learn a lot of things like how to create components, how to do wireframing and prototyping, and also how to make cards and group items.
#### Overall, I still haven't added fidelity and proper images, and fonts to this project as i was just playing around with the features of figma.
